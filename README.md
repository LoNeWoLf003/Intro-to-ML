# Introduction to Machine Learning

Under the curriculum of MAKAUT, Introduction to Machine Learning is included in the 5th semester for B.Tech. in CSE (AIML). So I decided, why not make a centralised system where all works would be available for everyone in a structured way!

Here you can find all the activities which are done in the ML Lab in the respective dated folders.
